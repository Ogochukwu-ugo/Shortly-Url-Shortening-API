This is a Frontend Mentor's URL shortening API coding challenge that aims to help one improve their coding skills by building realistic projects.

## The Challenge
 
 The challenge is to build out the landing page found in the design folder, integrate with the [shrtcode API](https://app.shrtco.de/) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
 Also, it is expected that users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
    - The `input` field is empty


  ### The Building Process
  To build out the solution to the url shortening api webpage, I decided to use React Js framework, so I can practice and learn react more.
  The following are the steps taken to enable me complete the project:
  
  - Setting up the development environment: To set up the dev environment, I opened the file folder on my VS Code terminal and then ran ``` npx create-react-app shortly``` and this command created a react app named shortly inside my already opened folder, with all the essential dependencies.

  - Adding up the extra tools needed: To make sure the application which I'm about to develop functions as expected, I installed extra dependencies using ```npm install``` followed by the dependecies needed. Below are the extra tools installed:

  * react-router-dom for routing and navigating freely,
  * react-bootstrap for styling the application, and,
  * react-icons.

  Although I'm still working on this project, these are the dependencies that has been added to the application as at the time of this documentation. 
  Due to the time frame giving for the completion of the project, I started immeidiately working on the project before creating a GitHub repository. 

  ### Building of the application in full
  Since the react framework is component base, I started developing the application by cleaning up the default codes on the App.js file, and added the codes which I needed to make the app to start running. After that, I ran ```npm start`` so my work can runs the app in the development mode.\
  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

  I cotinued my work by creating a component folder where I created more folders which would be holding the different files that will be having the codes essential for the app development.
